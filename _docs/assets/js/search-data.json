    "title": "Bash",
    "content": "One of the most commonly used shell command languages and the default shell in most popular Linux distributions. User customizations are commonly found in .bashrc. The full path is: “/home/username/.bashrc”. If the user is root, then the full path is: “/root”. Creating a new user may not include a new home directory, in which case Bash doesn’t setup customization options for you. To do this, do the following: . | Create a new home directory and transfer its ownership to the new user (assuming that you’re the root user) cd /home mkdir username # The new user's username chown username:username username cd username . | Create “.bash_profile” using touch .bash_profile and use your favourite editor to append the following code: if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then source ~/.bashrc fi . | . To read about the difference between “.bash_profile” and “.bashrc”, and to learn more about them, read here . This post from Stack Overflow explains the order of which Bash loads configuration files. Bash is extremely customizable. Here is a starting point. ",
