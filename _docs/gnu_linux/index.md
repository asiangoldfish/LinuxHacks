# GNU/Linux

Commonly referred as just *Linux*. This section covers configuring the
distributions that I personally. As this is *not* a tutorial, there are some
recommended prerequisites to reading and understanding the below subjects:

- Bash scripting
- Package managers. Ex: pip, apt, pacman, choco)
- Desktop environments and window managers
- File navigation and management
- Xorg

Note: Wayland is currently not listed.
