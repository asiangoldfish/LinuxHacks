# About my Personal Configurations
I have used Linux as my daily driver (more on than off) since 2021. I have written countless of configuration files and installed hundreds of packages across many [distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution). If you have used Linux for any amount of time, you probably have experienced installing Linux on several machines (virtual or physical) and synchronized them so they look and feel the same and share the same applications. Your computer may have crashed on you while installing the latest kernel, and upon rebooting you are directed to the UEFI or BIOS. My personal configurations were born as a result of countless hours of building the same applications from source and to be frustrated over missing dependencies. They are a result of uninstalling Python because I thought I didn't need it anymore, and hence screwing up the entire system. To have a script that automatically sets everything up from a brand new installation has saved my day countless of times.

To view my configurations, head over to my [GitHub Page](https://github.com/asiangoldfish/neovim-config). It's licensed under [MIT](https://github.com/asiangoldfish/neovim-config/blob/main/LICENSE). Feel free to adopt them to your own needs.

To view distribution specific details, look for the distribution name in the navigation bar (GNU / Linux -> Personal Configurations -> Distribution Name).
