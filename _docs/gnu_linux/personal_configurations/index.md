# Personal Configurations
In this section you will find my personal configurations. You can access them on
[GitHub](https://github.com/asiangoldfish/neovim-config.git). Please note that
the most up-to-date documentations are in the repository itself, but you will
still find most of the important and useful information here.

## Who is this for?
Before you deploy the configurations on your systems, you should know whether they suit you or not. If they don't nearly fullfill your requirements, you should probably find some other configurations.

I am a [computer science student](https://www.ntnu.no/ansatte/khai.duong). As a result, my configurations are centered around research, mathematics, computer graphics and note taking.
