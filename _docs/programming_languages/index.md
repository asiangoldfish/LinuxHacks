# Programming Languages

The *Programming Languages* section covers a small variety of commonly used modern languages. This ranges from C to Rust. There are so many tutorials written by smarter people than me, so you won't find any tutorials here. Instead, this wiki provides explanation of important concepts and cheat sheets. Thus consider this as a knowledge base and reference.
