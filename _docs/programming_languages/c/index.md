# The C Programming Language

The C programming language is one of the most widely used languages in the world. You may already be using a C powered device unknowingly, or services programmed in the C language. Some examples are, but not limited to:
- The websites you frequently visit.
- The Linux, Windows and MacOS kernels.
- Motherboard firmware (BIOS/UEFI).
- Your smart refrigerator and toaster.

This blog section is not intended to be a guide, but merely a look up resource for my ten year older self. You might still find it useful as much as I do in ten years.
